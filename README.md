# claude-code-notification

claude-code-notification is a lightweight CLI tool that integrates Claude AI into your development workflow through Git hooks. It provides intelligent, context-aware code suggestions and feedback by automatically triggering Claude during key moments—such as pre-commit or pre-push—via an interactive prompter. This helps developers catch issues early, improve code quality, and get AI-powered insights without leaving the terminal.
